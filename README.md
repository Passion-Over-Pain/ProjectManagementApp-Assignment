### Backend Development
- **Framework Used**: ASP.NET Core Web APIs with Entity Framework.  
  This provided the foundation for the backend, enabling robust database interaction and a structured API for the frontend.
- **Database**: SQL Server.  
  It served as the data storage system, managing user roles, tasks, and project information.

### Frontend Development
- **Technology Used**: React with React-Bootstrap for enhanced user interface components.  
  This made the interface responsive and user-friendly.

### Key Functionalities

#### Administrator Capabilities
1. **User Management**:  
   The Administrator can add, update, and delete users with the following roles:  
   - **Project Manager**
   - **Systems Analyst**
   - **Web Developer**
2. **Role-Based Authentication and Authorization**:  
   Access to the system is restricted based on roles, ensuring secure login and specific functionalities for each user type.

#### Project Manager Capabilities
1. **Project Management**:  
   - Create, read, update, and delete projects.  
   - Assign tasks to Systems Analysts and Web Developers.  
2. **Task Assignment**:  
   - Tasks include mandatory fields like task title and description.  
   - Tasks can be tracked by status: “To Start,” “In Progress,” and “Complete.”
3. **Employee Management**:  
   - View a list of all employees and search for specific employees by name.  
   - Filter employees by job title.  
4. **Task Tracking**:  
   - View tasks by their status, assigned time of completion, and actual time of completion.

#### Systems Analyst & Web Developer Capabilities
1. **Task Interaction**:  
   - View tasks assigned to them.  
   - Update task status using a dropdown menu to select between “To Start,” “In Progress,” and “Complete.”  
2. **Task Status View**:  
   - Tasks can be organized and viewed by their current status.

### Additional Project Details
- **Presentation**:  
  The functionalities were demonstrated in a video no longer than 5 minutes, showcasing the features without presenting the code.
- **Video Guidelines**:  
  - The video is recorded using relevant video apps (not a mobile phone camera).  
  - The link to the video was provided in a document and tested for accessibility.  
  - The presentation focused on the application’s functionalities aligned with the rubric.  
  - No code was shown during the video presentation rather a sole focus on the UI and UX.
- **Submission**:  
  - A Zip folder was submitted containing the project files, the presentation video, and a document with group details (names, student numbers, signatures, and video link).

### Challenges and Research
- Some features, such as Role-Based Authentication and the integration of React with ASP.NET Core, required additional research and learning. This fulfilled the research component of the course.

### Personal Learning Outcome
This project allowed me to integrate multiple technologies into a cohesive system while ensuring security and usability, showcasing the ability to manage real-world project requirements effectively.
